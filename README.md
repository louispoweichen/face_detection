# face_detection

We try different models for face detection and alignment.  
The processes are shown in the following jupyter notebooks.

1. [OpenCV Harr Cascade classifier](https://github.com/louispoweichen/face_detection/blob/master/opencv_haar_cascade_classifier.ipynb)

2. [MTCNN](https://github.com/louispoweichen/face_detection/blob/master/face_detection_MTCNN.ipynb)  
  
3. [Head Pose Estimation](https://github.com/louispoweichen/face_detection/blob/master/HeadPose_OpenCV_dlib.ipynb)
